# Visual Basic Sales Program

I found a college student asking for assistance with this challenge online and figured I would attempt to help him. He was able to finish the assignment on time.

This was the first time I had used VB and Windows Forms.

Challenge can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/JMHU184).

I did deviate from the challenge in a couple ways:

- Used a different layout
- Didn't include a nested if
