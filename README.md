# Visual Basic Sales Program

I found this assignment/challenge online and figured I would give it a shot. This was the first time I had used VB and Windows Forms.

Challenge can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/JMHU184).

I did deviate from the challenge in a couple ways:

- Used a different layout
- Didn't include a nested if
